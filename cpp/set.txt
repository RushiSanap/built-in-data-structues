		Iterators
		
begin()		Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the set
end()		Returns an iterator pointing to the theoretical element that follows the last element in the set
rbegin() 	Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the last element in the set (reverse beginning). It moves from last to first element
rend() 		Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the theoretical element preceding the first element in the set (considered as reverse end)
cbegin()	Returns a constant iterator pointing to the first element in the set.
cend()		Returns a constant iterator pointing to the theoretical element that follows the last element in the set.
crbegin()	Returns a constant reverse iterator pointing to the last element in the set (reverse beginning). It moves from last to first element
crend()		Returns a constant reverse iterator pointing to the theoretical element preceding the first element in the set (considered as reverse end)


		Capacity
		
size()		Returns the number of elements in the set.
max_size()	Returns the maximum number of elements that the set can hold.
empty() 	Returns whether the container is empty.		

		Modifiers

insert(g)	It inserts new elements 'g' before the element at the specified position
insert(iterator, g)Adds a new element ‘g’ at the position pointed by the iterator.
erase(g)	Removes the value ‘g’ from the set.
erase(iterator)	Removes the element at the position pointed by the iterator.
swap()		It is used to swap the contents of one set with another set of same type. Sizes may differ.
find(const g)	Returns an iterator to the element ‘g’ in the set if found, else returns the iterator to end.
count(const g)	Returns 1 or 0 based on whether the element ‘g’ is present in the set or not.
clear()		It is used to remove all the elements of the set container
emplace()	It extends the container by inserting new element at position
